# Official

This document highlights how you can get access to our official repos and maintain ProjectStreak officially for your device.

### So how do you do it?

Create an issue [here](https://github.com/ProjectStreak-Devices/official_devices/issues/new?template=form.md) - make sure to follow format.

For an official status, your device should have proper commit messages, commit history and authorship. You must also maintain your own trees. Applications with trees with one "Streak-ify" commit which only contains rebranding will be rejected.

After being accepted for official maintainership, check [**this document**](https://github.com/ProjectStreak/Streak_Documents/blob/twelve/Bringup.md).
